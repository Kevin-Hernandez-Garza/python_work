Embarking on my journey to learn Python programming language, and blogging what I have learned through reading this 3<sup>rd</sup> edition of the Python Crash Course book.

### Chapter One

In this chapter I learned to set up my code editor and update my Mac to the latest version of Python. I also create a repo and ran my first line of code outputting Hello World! for good luck ✨. Three applications that I hope to build as a beginner to show my expertise are a simple calculator ㉓, to-do list ✅, and a web scraper 🧹.


### Chapter Two

I have learned how to declare variables, use whitespace, and also strip whitespace in order clean up user input in order to store it properly. Additionally, learned a method to remove prefix of a URL. Finally, I also learned how to remove suffix from the end of a string and the whole chapter was reinforced with some exercises. 💪🏼

I also looked at the manipulation of integers.  We finished the chapter by llok at what float numbers look like and the mistakes that they might cause, and you cannot forget about the importance of commenting your code for easier readability. 📚


### Chapter Three

In this chapter I am learning about the benefits of using lists in order to store millions of data of any type, and be able to access it at your convenience. I also learned how to remove elements from removing the last item to a specific element, and even without knowing where that element is on the list ❌. 

### Chapter Four

I just learned on how to refactor my code to avoid repetitive code while also avoid indexing errors and access long lists by using the for loop. 📈 I also learned how to print a range of numbers and put them in a list. Additionally, I learned something more in-depth which is learning how to add a third argument to the range functions and skipped certain numbers along with raising them into a power. I learned how to find the min, max, and sum of a list. Moreover, I learned how to write my own list comprehension to minimize my coding lines. In this chapter we also learning how to slice a list and skip certain elements. I also learned how to copy an existing list. 

### Chapter Five
In this chapter we are learning all about IF statements. We are stating with the basics and conditional tests. I learned how case sensitive conditional tests works and how programs use methods such as the lower method to check all variations of a username to ensure they are unique.
