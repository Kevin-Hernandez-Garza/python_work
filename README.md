Embarking on my journey to learn Python programming language, and blogging what I have learned through reading this 3<sup>rd</sup> edition of the Python Crash Course book.

-[ Chapter One](#chapter-one)

-[ Chapter Two](#chapter-two)

-[ Chapter Three](#chapter-three)


### Chapter One

In this chapter I learned to set up my code editor and update my Mac to the latest version of Python. I also create a repo and ran my first line of code outputting Hello World! for good luck ✨. Three applications that I hope to build as a beginner to show my expertise are a simple calculator ㉓, to-do list ✅, and a web scraper 🧹.


### Chapter Two

I have learned how to declare variables, use whitespace, and also strip whitespace in order clean up user input in order to store it properly. Additionally, learned a method to remove prefix of a URL. Finally, I also learned how to remove suffix from the end of a string and the whole chapter was reinforced with some exercises. 💪🏼
