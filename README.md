# Python Journey ðŸ‘¾

Embarking on my journey to learn Python programming language, and blogging what I have learned through reading this 3<sup>rd</sup> edition of the Python Crash Course book.  


## Table of Contents ðŸ“š

-[ Chapter One](#chapter-one)

-[ Chapter Two](#chapter-two)


### Chapter One

In this chapter I learned to set up my code editor and update my Mac to the latest version of Python. I also create a repo and ran my first line of code outputting Hello World! for good luck âœ¨. Three applications that I hope to build as a beginner to show my expertise are a simple calculator ã‰“, to-do list âœ…, and a web scraper ðŸ§¹.


### Chapter Two
