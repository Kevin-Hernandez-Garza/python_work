### Chapter One

In this chapter I learned to set up my code editor and update my Mac to the latest version of Python. I also create a repo and ran my first line of code outputting Hello World! for good luck ✨. Three applications that I hope to build as a beginner to show my expertise are a simple calculator ㉓, to-do list ✅, and a web scraper 🧹.


### Chapter Two

I have learned how to declare variables, use whitespace, and also strip whitespace in order clean up user input in order to store it properly. Additionally, learned a method to remove prefix of a URL. Finally, I also learned how to remove suffix from the end of a string and the whole chapter was reinforced with some exercises. 💪🏼

I also looked at the manipulation of integers.  We finished the chapter by llok at what float numbers look like and the mistakes that they might cause, and you cannot forget about the importance of commenting your code for easier readability. 📚


### Chapter Three

In this chapter I am learning about the benefits of using lists in order to store millions of data of any type, and be able to access it at your convenience. I also learned how to remove elements from removing the last item to a specific element, and even without knowing where that element is on the list ❌.
